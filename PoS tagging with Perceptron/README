Usage Instruction
=================

To run the program, simply use the following command without any arguments:

python3 hw2.py 




Performance
===========
With 10 iterations of training, the model achieves 93.94% accuracy on the test set. In HW1, I had achieved an accuracy of 95.44%, however, that was only achieved when the given weights were shifted by +30. Without the shifting, it had an accuracy close to zero. The current model does a more robust job, as can be seen from the training and validation accuracies in the 10 iterations, as given below:



itr 1
Training set accuracy: 0.915
Dev set accuracy: 0.922

itr2
Training set accuracy: 0.945
Dev set accuracy: 0.927

itr3
Training set accuracy: 0.953
Dev set accuracy: 0.926

itr4
Training set accuracy: 0.956
Dev set accuracy: 0.931

itr5
Training set accuracy: 0.958
Dev set accuracy: 0.932

itr 6
Training set accuracy: 0.960
Dev set accuracy: 0.931

itr 7
Training set accuracy: 0.961
Dev set accuracy: 0.929

itr 8
Training set accuracy: 0.962
Dev set accuracy: 0.929

itr 9
Training set accuracy: 0.963
Dev set accuracy: 0.930

itr 10
Training set accuracy: 0.963
Dev set accuracy: 0.933


Test set accuracy: 0.9394185308023428


These accuracies can be printed on the console by running the program. The algorithm is commented inline.
