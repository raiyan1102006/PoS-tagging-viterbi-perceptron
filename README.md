# Parts of Speech Tagging 

**Author:** Raiyan Abdul Baten

These two projects were done as part of homeworks in the CSC448 Statistical Speech and Language Processing course at the University of Rochester.

## 1. Viterbi decoding
In this project, parts of speech tagging is done using Viterbi decoding. The weights are given. See the Readme file for details.

## 2. Perceptron
In this project, Viterbi decoding is once again used for decoding, but the weights are trained using Perceptron and HMM-based features. See the Readme file for details.
